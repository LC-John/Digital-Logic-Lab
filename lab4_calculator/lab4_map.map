Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:LIT:178 - Clock buffer BUFGMUX symbol
   "physical_group_XLXI_1/XLXN_29/XLXI_1/XLXI_8" (output signal=XLXI_1/XLXN_29)
   does not drive clock loads. Driving only non-clock loads with a clock buffer
   will cause ALL of the dedicated clock routing resources for this buffer to be
   wasted. The non-clock loads are:
   Pin I0 of XLXI_1/XLXI_4/XLXI_1/XLXI_10
   Pin I1 of XLXI_1/XLXI_1/XLXI_2/XLXI_10
   Pin I1 of XLXI_1/XLXI_2/XLXI_2/XLXI_10
   Pin I1 of XLXI_1/XLXI_3/XLXI_2/XLXI_10

   XLXI_3/XLXI_1/Binary_7_not0001 is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
